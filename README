How to use the sha256sums.txt files?
------------------------------------

These files exist in this repo due to the rules in the bootcamp, all team members must
submit the same code in all group assignments. So thats why sha256sum might come handy.

If you want to check your local files against the files in the repo run the following command:

$ sha256sum -c sha256sums.txt

The output must be like below:

Q1.sh: OK
Q2.sh: OK

If you see a bunvh of Oks, you're good to Go!
